# Simple C Programs Compiler
Author: Rimsha Rizvi

## Description:
The Simple C Programs Compiler is a F# based program that is used to compile simple C programs. The program is divided into three main components, each handled by a separate file:
1. **lexer.fs** - The lexical analyzer, which translates the input C program into a list of lexical units or "tokens".
2. **parser.fs** - The parser, which analyzes the list of tokens generated by the lexer to create an abstract syntax tree representing the structure of the C program.
3. **main.fs** - The main file of the application, which combines the lexer and parser to compile the C program.

## Files:
**lexer.fs:**  
The lexical analyzer for simple C programs. This component translates the input into a list of lexical units or "tokens". Each token is a string, and the end result is a list of strings. This component is responsible for identifying keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and other elements in the C program.

**parser.fs:**  
The parser component for simple C programs. It takes the list of tokens generated by the lexer and analyzes them to determine if the program meets the syntax rules of simple C. If the program is valid, it returns the string "success", otherwise it returns a string of the form "syntax_error:...". This component is responsible for checking the syntax rules of simple C, including empty statements, variable declarations, input/output statements, assignments, and if statements.

**main.fs:**  
The main file of the application, which combines the lexer and parser to compile the C program. It is responsible for taking the filename of the C program as input from the user, and then calling the lexer and parser to compile the program.

## How to Run the Application:
To compile a simple C program, follow these steps:
1. Run main.fs file.
2. Input the filename of the C program when prompted.
3. The compiler will then print out the list of tokens identified by the lexer, and the result of the parsing.
